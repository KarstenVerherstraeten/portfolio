		"description": "DubmSchool is a robust login system with an integrated dashboard, developed using the Django framework and Python. Initially unfamiliar with Django, I dedicated a week to mastering its fundamentals through official tutorials before diving into implementation.\n The login system allows users to register and sign in, with role-based functionality enabling personalized experiences. Depending on the assigned role (e.g., student or teacher), users gain access to specific features and actions. For instance, teachers can access additional tools and resources, while students have a streamlined interface designed for their needs. \nThe project showcases my ability to quickly learn new technologies and apply them to create practical, user-focused solutions, combining efficient backend programming with intuitive design.",

		"description": "I set out to create a prototype using WebRTC, inspired by the classic chat app Omegle. This led me to build my own version, Omogle. Initially, I tried developing the project using React, but I quickly realized that taking on too much at once was slowing my progress. To simplify, I switched to using vanilla JavaScript for the foundation. I developed the frontend with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and implemented a WebSocket server for the backend. In just five days, I built a functional application that allows users to anonymously chat in real-time. While not perfect, the project features a straightforward and intuitive design, showcasing my ability to adapt and deliver a working prototype under tight constraints.",

		"description": "I decided to combine my love for music with technology by creating a jukebox using Spotify's extensive but strict APIs. Initially, I attempted to build the project in React, but the challenge stemmed from understanding Spotify's API documentation rather than the framework itself. To simplify, I started fresh with vanilla JavaScript for the frontend and a Node.js-based backend using Express, dotenv, CORS, and Axios. After thoroughly reviewing Spotify's documentation and following the necessary steps, I successfully retrieved my playlist. Implementing the playback system proved tricky due to licensing requirements that needed to be passed to my web application. Despite these challenges, the end result after five days is something Iâ€™m proud of. The jukebox now allows users to select songs, pause, and resume playback seamlessly.",

After five days of work, the result is a functional and interactive quiz system that effectively combines real-time updates with a smooth user experience.",
